## Backends for libGDX, easy to build

Since we have no regular libGDX releases anymore, it is a problem to fix or extend backend behaviour that can't be overriden.
While there's always a way to work around bugs in the core project, this is often not possible in the backends.

This is where this repo comes in.

If you need to change build-in behaviour, but don't manage to get the complete libGDX repo to build, don't want to 
build your very own version or don't want to use snapshot versions, this repo is what you need. Check my own additions to see
what else is changed.


### How to build

* Clone this repo
* Checkout the revision you need (next paragraph)
* Type `gradlew install`
* Change your project's backend dependency to the one you wish

### How to use as a dependency

In case you don't want to change something here yourself, but just want to use some of the additions, you can also use a Jitpack dependency.
Don't forget to add Jitpack as a repo to your project:

    allprojects {
	    repositories {
		    ...
		    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	    }
    }

- [ ] Electron extensions

## For use with libGDX 1.9.8 core

### 1.98.0

This is exactly like libGDX 1.9.8. The backends in this version can be used only with libGDX 1.9.8.

Checkout branch [release/1.98.0](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/gdx-backends/tree/release/1.98.0) to use this version.
